- 👋 Hi, I’m @KentBeck

- 👀 I’m interested in:
* 3X: Explore/Expand/Extract. As a product matures, the tradeoffs affecting its development change dramatically. What are these changes and how can we respond to them?
* Power law distributions. Power laws appear despite our best efforts. How should we adapt our tools and techniques to the inexorable laws of nature.
* Programs as nature. I study the structure and evolution of programs using the same tools used to study the structure and evolution of the natural world.
* Quantitative studies of software engineering. For example, I have data that implies that programming language does not affect the size of diffs but deployment frequency does.
* Coaching. How to deliver it, scale it, teach it, and measure it.
* Tree-based tools. Source text is dead, it's just taking a while to quit twitching. Some day the whole toolchain, from editors on, will work with syntax trees.
* Smalltalk. What does Smalltalk still have to teach the programmers of today? Lots, it turns out.
* Reversibility. When you can un-make decisions, then you can afford to make many more of them.
* Software development at scale. How can we visualize work flowing through tens of thousands of developers, designers, project managers, and operations engineers? How can we optimize based on data from decades of development?
* Software design, as seen in the tidyfirst.substack.com newsletter/book serial.
